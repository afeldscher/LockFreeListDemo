# LockFreeListDemo
Demo of a Lock-Free Linked List for CS-361

To run this project simply do a gradle build. This will run all of the unit tests and make a jar of the main test.
You can run this test by executing the jar, java -jar ./build/libs/LockFreeListDemo.jar

The code was written in intelij, I recommend opening the project with it.

Note: The ConcurrentLinkedQueue file included in this repo is not mine, it is part of the open-jdk java implementation. I have recreated it here simply for educational purposes.
